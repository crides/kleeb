This is a collection of the Kicad symbols, footprints and 3D models useful in keyboard creation other than normal mechanical switches and the ones included in Kicad's standard library, all in 6.0 format. I didn't create all of them, and some come from either other people on Discord, or from other online resources that isn't in a Git tree. Putting them in a centralized place means it's easier for people to use, distribute*, and compare, and changes can be made in a clearer way. I'll try to list the sources down below, but due to the nature of the sources they maybe incorrect/missing. If you have a problem with how I'm using/distributing them please let me know.

## License

Those directly created by me is licensed under MIT. Those came from Discord are technically in a grey zone, as they are shared without a (explicit) license. For those that came from other sources, the original license should be used. I do not intend to claim ownership over them, and they are here so they can be easily included in future projects.

### `pg1350`, `pg1232` and `pg1425`

These footprints are autogenerated with python scripts cuz I hate hand making all the variants I need for choc. It uses [my fork of kicad-footprint-generator](https://github.com/crides/kicad-footprint-generator). The changes in the generator are basically usability changes for myself, and you'll see why in the diff.

The pg1350 footprint dimensions (i.e. pin sizes & locations) is originally taken from [Keebio](https://github.com/keebio/Keebio-Parts.pretty), the pg1232 ones from [here](https://github.com/tamanishi/Kailh_PG1232), and the pg1425 ones from [Kailh documentation](https://github.com/keyboardio/keyswitch_documentation/blob/master/datasheets/Kailh/CPG142501D02.pdf). They are converted to Python and modifications are added.

The outline on `User.Comments` is the outline of the side tabs, and the one on `User.Drawings` is slightly outside of the outline of the keycap, reflecting the spacing.

All of the footprints are auto generated now. Different letters signify different variations.
- `D`: includes diode in the footprint. It uses choc LED hole for (optional) SOD-123 diode placement, and the internal connections are already made. The center of the footprint is placed on the center of the diode to help with PCBA, and it's meant to be used with the custom symbol signifying that it has a builtin diode; 
- `R`: footprint is reversible. Througholes are included for both sides, another pad is used to connect the duplicated hole, and vias are used inside of the diode pads to connect the diodes on both sides, and silkscreens are duplicated on both sides;

All the following variants are spacing variants, which is useless for most people and I keep it here for my own sake.

- `S`: shorter spacing, only affects the cap outline. To be used with 15mm vertical spacing. This as close vertical as chocs gets without modding the switch itself;
- `SS`: "Super Short": even shorter spacing, only affects the cap outline. To be used with 13.5mm vertical spacing. This as close vertical as choc minis (pg1232) gets without modding the switch itself;
- `L` & `R`: only when used with `SS`; off centered spacing for use with same finger double column (e.g. most commonly the 2 columns for index finger, or columns for pinky).
- `N`: only when used with `SS`; as narrow as possible (14.5mm; or is the intersection of the `L` and `R` variants)

- `adafruit-sharp-memory-display-no-mounting`: As above, but edited to cut off mounting screw holes
- `BA1AAAPC`: [From Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/mpd-memory-protection-devices/BA1AAAPC/8119216). Low profile AAA battery holder
- `holyiot-18010`: From `@darryldh` on Discord
- `hro-type-c-31-m-12`: Not sure of source; I probably got it on Discord
- `MBK-1u`: [From `@darryldh` on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4564253)
- `SKRHAD`: [From Alps](https://tech.alpsalpine.com/prod/e/html/multicontrol/switch/skrh/skrhace010.html)
- `OLED-128x32`: Not sure from where. Model for the 128x32 OLED displays
- `TF31-12S-0.5SH`: Not sure from where exactly, should be a manufactorer model. 0.5mm pitched 12pin FPC ZIF socket
- `JST-PH-S2B-R`: [From SnapEDA on Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/short/p1d9b87m). JST PH SMD 2pin connector, commonly used for batteries. [Product on Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1769)
- `pg1350`, `pg1350-mbk`, `pg1232`, `pg1232-mbk`: created by me. pg1350 and pg1232 choc switch models with MBK 1u keycaps. The pg1350 model is taken directly from [here](https://grabcad.com/library/kailh-choc-low-profile-switch-1), and the MBK model from [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4564253/files). The pg1232 model is made by me through cutting and rejoining pieces of the pg1350 model, which should immitate the general model but is otherwise very janky. The joint choc and MBK models are simply the combinations of the switch models and the MBK model.
- `rp2040-zero`: From the low pro Discord from `@gerrycave` from WaveShare. _Giant_ model of the RP2040-Zero, recentered by me through FreeCAD.
- `EVQWGD001`: A copy of <https://grabcad.com/library/panasonic-evqwgd001-encoder-1#!>. Doesn't seem to match footprint
- `TM035035`: From @freznel on Discord, originated from Cirque.
